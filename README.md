This brief compares the data from 2009 and 2019. The year 2009 is chosen, because some data is only available starting from 2009. A period of ten years provides a long enough time frame to see changes. Since the most recent data has been updated in 2019, the data set also reflects a more accurate situation close to the year we are in now (2021).
